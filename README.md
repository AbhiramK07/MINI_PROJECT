# MISSING CHILD IDENTIFICATION USING FACE RECOGNITION WITH CNN

The Missing Child Identification Using Face Recognition with CNN project aims to harness 
advanced machine learning techniques to address the critical social issue of locating missing 
children. Utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), this application provides an 
efficient and user-friendly platform for users to upload images and receive predictions 
regarding potential matches from a comprehensive database of missing children. The project 
integrates cutting-edge facial recognition technology to facilitate accurate identification while 
ensuring a secure and accessible interface. Through rigorous testing and validation, the system 
demonstrates reliability and effectiveness in processing images and delivering results in real 
time. 
Despite its promising capabilities, the project acknowledges certain limitations, 
including data quality, privacy concerns, and model bias. To enhance the system's performance 
and impact, future developments may involve the integration of more extensive datasets, the 
exploration of innovative algorithms, and the incorporation of community engagement 
features. Ultimately, this project aspires to leverage artificial intelligence for the betterment of 
public safety, enabling families and authorities to work collaboratively in the search for missing 
children.
